Notes
-----

.. note::
   If parameters are not set within the module, the following environment variables can be used in decreasing order of precedence ``AWS_URL`` or ``EC2_URL``, ``AWS_PROFILE`` or ``AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE``, ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`` or ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY`` or ``EC2_ACCESS_KEY``, ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`` or ``AWS_SECRET_KEY`` or ``EC2_SECRET_KEY``, ``AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN`` or ``EC2_SECURITY_TOKEN``, ``AWS_REGION`` or ``EC2_REGION``, ``AWS_CA_BUNDLE``

   Ansible uses the boto configuration file (typically ~/.boto) if no credentials are provided. See https://boto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html

   ``AWS_REGION`` or ``EC2_REGION`` can be typically be used to specify the AWS region, when required, but this can also be configured in the boto config file
